## OptionM

The option effect allows short circuiting of programs for optional values.
It includes two basic operations: `option` and `non`.

The constrains placed by this effect is that there needs to be an implicit evidence of `MonadFilter[M[_]] 
for any runtime `M[_]` used in its interpretation. Short-circuiting with `none` does not mean that you'd end up with a
`None` value at some point. The final value in case of short-circuit is determined by the `MonadFilter[M[_]]#empty` for 
your target runtime `M[_]`.

### option

`option` allows a value of type `Option[_]` to be lifted into the context of `FreeS`. If a `None` it's found the program
will short circuit. 


```tut:book
import freestyle._
import freestyle.implicits._
import freestyle.effects.option._
import freestyle.effects.option.implicits._
import cats.implicits._

def programNone[F[_]: OptionM] =
  for {
    a <- 1.pure[FreeS[F, ?]]
    b <- OptionM[F].option[Int](None)
    c <- 1.pure[FreeS[F, ?]]
  } yield a + b + c
  
programNone[OptionM.Op].exec[Option]
```

If a `Some(_)` is found the value is extracted and lifted into the context and the programs resumes
normally.

```tut:book
def programSome[F[_]: OptionM] =
  for {
    a <- 1.pure[FreeS[F, ?]]
    b <- OptionM[F].option(Some(1))
    c <- 1.pure[FreeS[F, ?]]
  } yield a + b + c
  
programSome[OptionM.Op].exec[Option]
```

### none

`none` immediately short circuits the program without providing further information as to what the reason is. Handle with
care. 

```tut:book
def programNone2[F[_]: OptionM] =
  for {
    a <- 1.pure[FreeS[F, ?]]
    b <- OptionM[F].none[Int]
    c <- 1.pure[FreeS[F, ?]]
  } yield a + b + c
  
programNone2[OptionM.Op].exec[Option]
```
