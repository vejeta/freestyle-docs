# Handlers

Freestyle empowers program whose runtime can be easily overriden via implicit evidences.

As part of its design Freestyle is compatible with `Free` and traditional patterns around it. Apps build with Freestyle give developers the freedom
to choose automatic or manual algebras, modules and interpreters and intermix them as you see fit in applications based on the desired encoding.

## Implementation

Freestyle automatically generates an abstract definition of an interpreter for each one of the
algebras annotated with `@free`.
This allow you to build the proper runtime definitions for your algebras by simply extending the `Handler[M[_]]`
member in your algebras companion.

Consider the following algebra adapted to Freestyle from the [Typelevel Cats Free monads examples](http://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/freemonad.html)

```tut:book
import freestyle._
import cats.implicits._

@free trait KVStore[F[_]] {
  def put[A](key: String, value: A): FreeS[F, Unit]
  def get[A](key: String): FreeS[F, Option[A]]
  def delete(key: String): FreeS[F, Unit]
  def update[A](key: String, f: A => A): FreeS[F, Unit] = 
    get[A](key) flatMap {
      case Some(a) => put[A](key, f(a))
      case None => ().pure[FreeS[F, ?]]
    }
}
```

In order to define a runtime interpreter for it we simply extend `KVStore.Handler[M[_]]` and implement its abstract members.

```tut:book
import cats.data.State

type KVStoreState[A] = State[Map[String, Any], A]

implicit val kvStoreHandler: KVStore.Handler[KVStoreState] = new KVStore.Handler[KVStoreState] {
  def put[A](key: String, value: A): KVStoreState[Unit] =
    State.modify(_.updated(key, value))
  def get[A](key: String): KVStoreState[Option[A]] =
    State.inspect(_.get(key).map(_.asInstanceOf[A]))
  def delete(key: String): KVStoreState[Unit] =
    State.modify(_ - key)
}
```

As you may have noticed in Freestyle instead of implementing a Natural transformation `F ~> M` we implement methods that closely resemble each one of the smart constructors in our `@free` algebras.
This is not an imposition but rather a comvinience as the resulting instances are still Natural Transformations.

In the example above `KVStore.Handler[M[_]]` it's actually already a Natural transformation of type `KVStore.Op ~> KVStoreState` in which on its
`apply` function automatically delegates each step to the abstract method that you are implementing as part of the Handler.

Alternatively if you would rather implement a natural transformation by hand, you can still do that by choosing not to implement
`KVStore.Handler[M[_]]` and providing one like so:

```tut:book
import cats.~>

implicit def manualKvStoreHandler: KVStore.Op ~> KVStoreState = 
  new (KVStore.Op ~> KVStoreState) {
    def apply[A](fa: KVStore.Op[A]): KVStoreState[A] =
      fa match {
        case KVStore.PutOP(key, value) =>
          State.modify(_.updated(key, value))
        case KVStore.GetOP(key) =>
          State.inspect(_.get(key).map(_.asInstanceOf[A]))
        case KVStore.DeleteOP(key) =>
          State.modify(_ - key)
      }
}
```

## Composition

Freestyle performs automatic composition of interpreters by providing the implicit machinery necessary to derive a Module interpreter
by the evidence of it's algebras's interpreters.
To illustrate interpreter composition let's define a new algebra `Log` which we will compose with our `KVStore` operations.

```tut:book
@free trait Log[F[_]] {
  def info(msg: String): FreeS[F, Unit]
  def warn(msg: String): FreeS[F, Unit]
}
```

Once our algebra is defined we can easily write an interpreter for it

```tut:book
import cats.implicits._

implicit def logHandler: Log.Handler[KVStoreState] = 
  new Log.Handler[KVStoreState] {
    def info(msg: String): KVStoreState[Unit] = println("INFO: $msg").pure[KVStoreState]
    def warn(msg: String): KVStoreState[Unit] = println("WARN: $msg").pure[KVStoreState]
  }
```

Before we create a program where we combine all operations let's consider both `KVStore` and `Log` as part
of a module in our application

```tut:book
@module trait Backend[F[_]] {
  val store: KVStore[F]
  val log: Log[F]
}
```

When `@module` is materialized it will automatically create the `Coproduct` that matches interpreters necessary to run the `Free` structure
below.

```tut:book
def program[F[_]](implicit B: Backend[F]): FreeS[F, Option[Int]] = {
  import B.store._, B.log._
  for {
    _ <- put("wild-cats", 2)
    _ <- info("Added wild-cats")
    _ <- update[Int]("wild-cats", (_ + 12))
    _ <- info("Updated wild-cats")
    _ <- put("tame-cats", 5)
    n <- get[Int]("wild-cats")
    _ <- delete("tame-cats")
    _ <- warn("Deleted tame-cats")
  } yield n
}
```

Once we have combined our algebras we can simply evaluate them by providing implicit evidence of the Coproduct interpreters.
`import freestyle.implicits._` brings into scope among others the necessary implicit definitions to derive a unified interpreter given
implicit evidences of each one of the individual algebra's interpreters.

```tut:book
import freestyle.implicits._
program[Backend.Op].exec[KVStoreState]
```

Alternatively you can build your interpreters by hand if you wish not to use Freestyle's implicit machinery.
This may quickly grow unwildly as the number of algebras increase in an application but it's also possible in the spirit of providing two way compatibility
in all areas between manually built ADTs and Natural Transformations and the ones automatically derived by Freestyle.

## A note on performance

You've heard before that `With great power comes great responsibility.`. This is also true for apps based on `Free` structures.
While reifying your actions allows freedom of interpretation, you should also be aware that interpreting many individual steps in the `Free` monad can become a performance bottleneck if abused or used in hot spots of an application.

This is because apps built with `Free` reify each action in an in memory datastructure prior to being interpreted.
This structure is then is folded into a final result applying the `Handler` natural transformation over each defined action.
The entired process is also trampolined guaranteeing stack safety in the program declaration.

As a rule of thumb the approach that we've seen working in production is modeling as `Free` actions your key biz logic concepts and leaving the heavy lifting to the interpreters where needed.

For most common apps true bottlenecks are IO to Databases, Network or the file system and this is rarely a concern.


Now that we've learnt to define our own interpreters let's jump into [Parallelism](/docs/parallelism/)
